# MyElixirStatus (@Crowdhailer)

**Improving my skills with elixir/erlang/beam**

### Motivation

After several months working with various languages I have decided to pick one as my new language to master.
That new language is Elixir.
Key reasons for this choice are immutable data structures only, a fantastic foundation for handling concurrency and a community that values good tools.

This repo will form the reference for all my investigation into Elixir.
It is a curated todo list of topics I want to look at (If you think I have missed any do let me know).
My goal is to use Elixir for web development as soon as possible as I think it is a great language.
I hope that by making my notes public others might be able to start web development with Elixir sooner.

### The Giant Todo
